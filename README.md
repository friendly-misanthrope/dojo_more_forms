# React Application - User Form with Added Validations

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## User Form

Enter valid data in the form to see it displayed on the page in real-time.
Click 'Submit' to see the data displayed as JSON in the console.
In addition to displaying validations conditionally on the page,
the application will now refuse to submit the form if the data is not valid.
